# DRF-based Code Snippet API

This project is a Django REST Framework (DRF) based API for real-time code snippet sharing and version control. It allows developers to create, share, and manage code snippets in various programming languages, with built-in version control to track changes, forks, and merges.

## Features

- Create, share, and manage code snippets.
- Built-in version control for tracking changes.
- Rate and comment on snippets.
- Tag snippets by technologies or use cases (e.g., "Django," "Regex," "Data Parsing").
- Search across a rich database of solutions.
- Real-time collaboration on code snippets.
- Metrics on snippet usage and quality feedback.
